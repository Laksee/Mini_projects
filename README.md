These are some of the mini projects I'm building while learning the MERN stack through a course and self-practice. As I continue learning and experimenting, I’ll keep uploading more projects here.

I’m exploring new concepts every day, and this repository reflects my journey and progress as a developer.

Stay tuned for more!
